# footballTeamCards
One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, I learned how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project covers concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.
